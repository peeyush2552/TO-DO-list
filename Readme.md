## Features
- Add new tasks with a description and due date
- Mark tasks as completed
- Edit and delete tasks
- View all tasks in a list format
- User authentication for secure access

## Technologies Used
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing tasks and user data
- **Express**: Backend framework for building RESTful APIs
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (ensure you have a MongoDB instance running locally or remotely)

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/to-do.git
    cd to-do
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    - For the server:
        ```bash
        cd server
        npm install
        ```
    - For the client:
        ```bash
        cd client
        npm install
        ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and set the following variables:
        - `MONGODB_URI`: The MongoDB connection URI
        - `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
        - Any other necessary environment variables for the server

4. **Start the application**:
    - For the server:
        ```bash
        cd server
        npm start
        ```
    - For the client:
        ```bash
        cd client
        npm start
        ```

    The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` and the client will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to access the To-Do app.
